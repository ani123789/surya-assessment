# Introduction & Instructions

The problems outlined here are designed to be approachable and fun to work on, but we'd love to see you tackle them with the same level of professionalism you'd bring to real-world projects. These problems mirror the types of challenges you'll encounter in your day-to-day work. Feel free to look up any documentation online—in fact, we've intentionally designed these problems to encourage you to research and learn as you go!

The problems below are structured so that no single candidate would be expected to know everything needed to solve them completely. That's totally normal! What we're really looking for is your ability to research, learn, and approach problems systematically.

## Problems

There are 3 problems defined in this repository, *you are expected to do only one problem*:

- [UI-Dashboards](ui-dashboards/README.md): Suitable for browser-based UI applications.
- [Product APIs](product-apis/README.md): Suitable for creating APIs for back-end applications.
- [Mobile UI Screens](mobile-ui-screens/README.md): Suitable for mobile developers.

Each problem has a folder for it. The problem definition, and instructions are in the README of each folder.

Each problem has been divided into "steps", i.e., small features that can be completed one after the other, as they build incrementally on top of each other.

**It is unlikely that you will have the time to take on more than one problem**. Please read through all problem descriptions and choose the one that feels like the best fit for your skills and interests. Quality over quantity is what we're looking for!

## Submission Process

You are free to use any framework/language/libraries of your choice. Common choices include (but are not limited to):

- Java
- Python
- Kotlin
- Swift
- Dart
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Ruby
- ReactJS
- Angular
- Flutter
- SwiftUI
- Jetpack Compose

You are not required to use one of the above - you are free to use any framework or language of your choice. If, however, you are using something not on the list above, please include clear instructions on how to run your project. For example, if your project uses Python, specify the Python version used, and include a Requirements.md file with instructions on how to build the your project.

Put your solution within the specific folder of your problem. For example, if you are working on `ui-dashboards`, please put your entire solution under the `ui-dashboards` folder. **If you put it at the root of the repository, or in any place other than the relevant problem folder, your solution will not be considered.**

Please ensure that you _push_ your changes to the GitHub repository, to the `main` branch. **If your final solution is not pushed to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, your submission will not be considered.**

## Evaluation Criteria

A working solution is only the first step of our evaluation criteria. If your solution does not work (i.e., we are not able to compile and run it successfully), your solution will not be considered.

There is no single “correct” solution to any of these problems. They are deliberately slightly open-ended to allow you room to make your own decisions and judgement. If you are meeting the requirements specified in the problem statement, your submission will be considered to be working.

If your solution runs successfully, you will be graded based primarily on correctness and attention to detail. Here are some key areas we'll be looking at:

- UI layout files should be replicated as closely as possible. The UI designs we've shared are meant to be followed precisely.
- If you're writing API definitions, please make sure to handle edge cases such as missing data, invalid requests, etc.
- If you're working with UI components, we'd appreciate attention to formatting details like amounts, units, etc.

We value quality over quantity. For example, solving 3 steps poorly will be graded lower than solving 2 steps well. Half-completed steps won't be considered for submission.
